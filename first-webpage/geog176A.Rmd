In the summer of 2020 I took a class GIS course based in R. I wrote code, and worked with data science concepts. Here is a collection of links:

## [Processing Covid-19 Data](https://ucsbaporter.github.io/geog176A-labs/Lab-02.html)

- In this assignment we worked with NY Times Covid-19 data to review trends in the State of California. 
- Included is a review of Covid-19 case counts for counties within the State of California.
- The included charts are designed to update with current daily information and therefore is a real-time review of how this pandemic is spreading throughout the state. 
- The charts include: Cumulative case counts for the top 5 counties, The most new case counts for the top 5 counties, as well as the top 5 counties when reviewing population (by 100,000), and lastly an alphabetical list of counties with the lowest new cases when reviewing population (by 100,000). 
- Additionally, I compared Covid-19 state data between California, Florida, Louisiana, and New York,  taking into account overall state population and cases.  
- In the future these same steps could be used to continue to monitor certain state or county features of the Covid-19 pandemic, or any other trend with the public dataset.
