I’m a 4th year undergraduate student at the University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB), majoring in Biological Anthropology, Archaeology, and a minor in Spatial Studies (Spatial Science).  Currently, working towards an honor distinction in Biological Anthropology.  The honors project sets out to determine if domestic abuse patterns can be determined based on social structure by reviewing osteological remains from group burial sites.  Additionally, I have worked as a lab assistant in the UCSB Walker Bioarchaeology and Biochemistry Lab.  This role included dental isotope testing, human forensic recovery work in Montecito, and as a TA in ANTH 121: Human Evolution.  During the Fall '20 quarter I will continue participating as a lab assistant, and TA in ANTH 180A: Osteology (both remotely due to Covid-19).  

Outside of UCSB: Summer '19, chosen for one position as the summer intern at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) in the Conservation department.  After the completion of the internship at SFMOMA, I was hired on as the freelance Illustrator for the conservation documentation of the Diego Rivera “Pan American Unity” mural. Additionally, I have completed an AA in Psychology and Fashion Design.

I've previously taken a course in ArcGIS, QGIS, and now Rstudio including Github.  This area of study holds my interest for a multitude of reasons including professional and personal work projects.  A better understanding of such a great tool in geo spatial data has many application within Anthropology, Archaeology, and Medical research, which are my potential future education and career pathways.  Additionally, learning how to use these programs and learning how to code has been very enjoyable and challenging.  I'm capable of finding public data sets, referencing to geo spatial locations, creating code, and experimenting the best way to present information.  In the future, I plan to continue increasing my proficiency in Rstudio and GIS programs.
